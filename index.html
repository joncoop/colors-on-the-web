<h2>The decimal system:</h2>

<p>Before we look at hexidecimal numbers, let's review the decimal system that we are all familiar with. The decimal system (dec) has 10 symbols that represent amounts (0-9). Because we only have 10 symbols, it is necessary to add places if we want to represent any quantity larger than nine. This is also why we carry and borrow in multiples of 10. More generally, you should understand that all numbers can be interpreted using powers of 10.</p>

<p>Consider at the number 52,943. We know that the 5 doesn't actually represent 5 things but rather 50,000 or 5*10^4. The 2 represents 2,000 or 2*10^3 and so on. This means we can the full expansion using powers of 10 is as follows:</p>

<pre>
	5*10^4 + 2*10^3 + 9*10^2 + 4*10^1 + 3*10^0.
</pre>

<p>Notice how the powers from left to right start at zero in increase each place to the left. (Don't forget that a number raised to the 0th power is 1.) The number 10 is used in each term because there are 10 symbols in the system, and the multiplied digits are the values you actually see when you look at a number. Being aware of this pattern will make understanding other number systems quite easy.</p>

<h2>The hexadecimal system:</h2>

<p>The hexadecimal system (hex=6 and dec=10) has 16 symbols to represent values: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. The digits 0-9 represent the same amounts of things they do in decimal, but rather than have to use two digits to represent quantities such as 10 another digit, A, is used. B represents 11, C 12, D 13, E 14, and F 15. Therefore, two digits aren't needed until you want to represent sixteen things. Check out how you would count in hexadecimal and notice how the rules are identical to decimal.</p>

<pre>
	 0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F
	10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1A 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F
	20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2A 2B 2C 2D 2E 2F
	30 31 32 33 34 35 ...
</pre>

<p>Now that we understand the amounts that each symbol represents and understand the pattern used to represent a number using powers of its base, we can convert hexadecimal to decimal.</p>

<h3>Example 1:</h3>

<pre>
	#C38 = 12*16^2 + 3*16^1 + 8*16^0
	     = 3072 + 48 + 8
	     = 3128
</pre>

<p>All we did was the quantity represented by each digit times the number of symbols in the system raised to the power associated with the place value.</p>

<h3>Example 2:</h3>

<pre>
	#9F0A = 9*16^3 + F*16^2 + 0*16^1 + 10*16^0
	      = 36864 + 3840 + 0 + 10
	      = 40714
</pre>

<p>You should also notice that the hexadecimal system allows us to represent large quantities much more compactly than in decimal.</p>

<h2>Interpreting hexadecimal numbers as colors:</h2>

<!--<img src="" alt="Mann Logo">-->

<p>Look at the value for J.L Mann blue (#57B7DF). The 57 in the Mann blue represents the intensity of red light, the B7 is the intensity of green, and the DF is the intensity of blue. In fact, in every color code, the first two digits represent the intensity of red, the next green, and the last blue. In the next example, let's break Mann blue down into decimal representations for each of its component colors.</p>

<h3>Example 3:</h3>

<pre>
	#57B7DF --> 57 = 5*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 87 Red
		    B7 = 11*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 183 Green
		    DF = 13^16^1 + 15*16^0 = 223 Blue
</pre>

<p>So Mann blue is mostly blue light with a good bit of green and a smaller amount of red light added to lighten it up a bit.</p>

<h3>Example 4:</h3>

<pre>
	#0AC359 --> 0A = 0*16^1 + 7*16^0 = 10 Red
		    C3 = 12*16^1 + 3*16^0 = 195 Green
		    59 = 5^16^1 + 9*16^0 = 89 Blue
</pre>

<p>It's mostly green with some blue and almost no red. So you should suspect that it is sort of a bluish green.</p>
	
<p>When you see that the above color has a green value of 195, the next obvious question should be "Out of what?" So let's look at the range of values for each component in decimal. Hexadecimal 00 is obviously decimal 0. The highest hexadecimal value is #FF. #FF = 15*16^1 + 15*16^0 = 255. This means each component color can take on 256 unique values from 0 to 255. Furthermore, we can determine the total number of colors we can display on a web page by multiplying 256 reds * 256 greens * 256 blues to get 16,777,216 colors.</p>

<p>For each hexadecimal color code listed, see if you can guess what it looks like without testing it on a web page. You can mouse over the color to get a description of the color and an explanation.</p>
